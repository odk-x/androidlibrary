This project is __*actively maintained*__

The developer [wiki](https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/wiki) (including release notes) and [issues tracker](https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/issues) are located under the [**ODK-X Tool Suite**](https://github.com/odk-x) project.

This is a library APK used by all the ODK 2.0 Android tools

## Branch Structure

There are three branches in our git workflow:
* *master* is where fully released and **stable** code lives. Changes flow into this branch from demo. Each merge correponds with an official release or a hot fix.
* *demo* is where **beta** versions are tested before release and also where we hold demo or preview versions of upcoming releases and new features. This branch is more stable than development but should still only be used for testing purposes. Changes flow into this branch from development.
* *development* is where new features and code changes are made. This branch is the bleeding edge and is **not stable**. It should only be used for development and testing purposes. If you want to submit a pull request, please do it against *development*.

## Setting up your environment and building the project

General instructions for setting up an ODK 2.0 environment can be found at our [DevEnv Setup wiki page](https://github.com/opendatakit/opendatakit/wiki/DevEnv-Setup)

Install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) and the [SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other).

Open the androidlibrary project directory in Android Studio.

Now you should be ready to build, by selecting `Build->Make Project`.

Alternatively, you can build from the command line using Gradle. From the root directory of this project, run:

`gradlew clean assemble`

For more details see the [Gradle documentation for Andoid](https://guides.gradle.org/building-android-apps/).

## Running

**NOTE** this project will NOT run on an Android device by itself, it is simply a library for use in other ODK projects.

## Downloading Binaries

You can use ivy (for the *development* and *demo* branches) and maven (for the *master* branch) to access prebuilt binaries within your project. Your build.gradle file might look like this:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        ivy {
            url 'http://cwe.cs.washington.edu:8082/artifactory/libs-demo/'
        }
        maven {
            url 'http://cwe.cs.washington.edu:8082/artifactory/libs-master/'
        }
        ivy {
            url 'http://cwe.cs.washington.edu:8082/artifactory/libs-snapshot/'
        }
    }
}

```

We are already doing this in our other projects such as our root build.gradle file in [Services](https://github.com/odk-x/services/blob/master/build.gradle). 

Each commit to the *development* branch is built and published to our Artifactory server's [snapshot library](http://cwe.cs.washington.edu:8082/artifactory/webapp/builds/androidlibrary/?2). They can be identified by their git hash in their versioning. They are also linked between our Jenkins build server and Artifactory by build number. 

Furthermore, each beta version published to the *demo* branch is published to our Artifactory server's [demo library](http://cwe.cs.washington.edu:8082/artifactory/webapp/builds/demo-androidlibrary/?4) and similarly linked to the Jenkins build server.

Finally, each release version published to the *master* branch is published to our Artifactory server's [master library](http://cwe:8082/artifactory/webapp/browserepo.html?2). However, these are NOT built by Jenkins; they are built and tested by hand for the release.
